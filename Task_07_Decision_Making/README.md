# Task 07 - Ethical Decision Report: Syracuse Men's Soccer

## Project Overview

This repository contains the submission for Research Task 07. The project's goal was to take the data-driven narrative from Task 05 (Syracuse Men's Soccer 2024 Season Analysis) and transform it into a formal, stakeholder-facing decision report for the team's Head Coach.

The report emphasizes actionable recommendations while conducting a rigorous analysis of the ethical implications, data reliability, potential biases, and overall robustness of the findings. The entire process is documented to ensure transparency and auditability, as required by the assignment instructions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

-   **`README.md`**: This file.
-   **`Stakeholder_Decision_Report.docx`**: The primary deliverableâ€”a formal report for the Head Coach.
-   **`/appendices`**: A directory containing all supporting documentation and evidence.
    -   `validate_stats.py`: The Python script used to validate the descriptive statistics that underpin the report's findings.
    -   `llm_prompts.txt`: The exact prompts used to generate the initial LLM narrative.
    -   `raw_llm_output.txt`: The raw, unedited text generated by the LLM in response to the prompts.
    -   `data_lineage.md`: A document detailing the origin, scope, and limitations of the dataset.
