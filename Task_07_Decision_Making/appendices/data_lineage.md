# Data Lineage and Provenance

### Data Source
-   **Origin:** The dataset was compiled from the official Syracuse University Athletics website (cuse.com).
-   **URL (example):** `https://cuse.com/sports/mens-soccer/stats/2024`
-   **Collection:** The data is publicly available and was manually transcribed into an Excel file.

### Scope and Limitations
-   **Time Frame:** The dataset covers the complete 2024 NCAA Men's Soccer season.
-   **Content:** It includes cumulative player statistics (Goals, Assists, Shots, etc.) and goalie performance.
-   **Limitations:**
    -   The data is cumulative and does **not** contain intra-game details (e.g., time of goals, player performance by half).
    -   It only includes players who appeared in games; it does not cover the full roster.
    -   The data lacks situational context (e.g., game state when shots were taken).

### Privacy and Ethical Concerns
-   **Privacy:** All data is in the public domain, relating to student-athletes' on-field performance in public competitions. The risk to individual privacy is considered low.
-   **Ethical Use:** The primary ethical concern is ensuring the data is not used to make high-stakes decisions (e.g., scholarship allocation) without significant additional context, as the dataset's limitations could lead to unfair assessments.
